# notes :  
>if databse is on remote server, allow connection to the database from the serveur where the script will be executed
Config files are in config_files/  
 - cert.cnf for the auto certification informations, can be personalized with Organization informations
 - config.yaml for all the conf params, going from database access to magento install options.


Securing mariadb installation should be done by user if required at the end of the setup.
